I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am interested in various aspects of foundations of computer science with an emphasis on cryptography. Many of the research problems I work on are theoretical problems motivated by practical applications of cryptography. I am also broadly interested in the foundations of cryptography, and the design of cryptographic protocols.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) advised by [Elaine Shi](http://elaineshi.com/).
I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/) and [Rachel Lin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rachel/). I also spent a significant amount of time working with [Ilan Komargodski](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ilank/) during my PhD during multiple internships at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com/cis/).
<!-- I spent the summers of 2021 and 2022 as a research intern at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com/cis/) working with [Ilan Komargodski](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ilank/).  -->
Even earlier, I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2018 with a Bachelor of Technology (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering and was advised by [Debdeep Mukhopadhyay](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdeep/) for my undergraduate thesis.
